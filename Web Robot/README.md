# WebRobot
This project purpose is about a web robot able to get data from a website by crawling all the webpage and finding content that interest the user. Since crawling is often limited by the policies of the server, this project is about trying to get through this kind of barrier and find a way to pursue the goal of getting data without being detected by the server.
